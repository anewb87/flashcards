# Flashcards: Test Your Dev Knowledge!

## Abstract

This is a program that simulates a set of flashcards through the command line. A user will be able to read the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

## How to Play

Install and set up the flashcards (see below). Then, in the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

A user will be greeted with *Welcome to Flashcards!* followed by the number of cards in their deck. They will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. The current answer selection will change colors, so the user can see which answer they've selected before submitting.

The user will be able to play through the entire deck of cards. At the end of the game, they will be informed that they have finished and will be presented with their score.
